        How to make text display when you click an image
    </h1>
    
     <div class="center">
        <img class="smaller-image" src="Images/Code.png"></img>
    </div>
    
     <p style="width: 75s%;" class="font-size white-text white-border">
              You need to use javascript to make text pop up when you click the image.
              So first you need to put the images in a var tag here to difine the images 
              and the text that you are gonna use in the website. You use the var tag and 
              getElementById to difine them, I made sure to name the var's something related
              to the img or the text. I put "Img" next to the images so I wouldn't get 
              them confused when I was adding the event listeners. I started the var with 
              the information with hitlerinfo so I know that anything below that is info. 
        </p>
        
        <div class="center">
        <img class="smaller-image" src="Images/Code 2.png"></img>
    </div>
    
        <p style="width: 75s%;" class="font-size white-text white-border">
              In the HTML part of the project you need to add the text and put the images 
              so they show in the website. You need to put an Id on the image wich has to 
              be the same as the var that you identified it with in the javascript. For example
              "hitlerImg" is the name of the var and the Id I put on the image so it connects the 
              two. I put them in the HTML so they can show up but I also put an Id on them so 
              I can use the javascript on the images. Its important that you name the Id's exactly
              the same as you named it with the var so it connects correctly. 
        </p>
        
        <div class="center">
        <img class="smaller-image" src="Images/Code 3.png"></img>
    </div>
    
    <p style="width: 75s%;" class="font-size white-text white-border">
              For the other part of the javascript and the most important part of the project you 
              need to add the event listeners. This is so the user can click on the image and it 
              will actually do something, in this case make text pop up when you click the image. 
              As you can see above, you add the img Id so the "click" event listener can work on 
              that specific image. Below that you put the "If else" statement to add conditions 
              to the image, you also put the Id for the info that you established before so that
              it gets the text and displays it once you click it. This allows for the click to 
              make the info disappear and appear depending on how many times the user clicks. 
              In this case click once to make the info appear and click again to make it disappear.
              Make sure to put the Id inside of the paragraph tag and that it matches the "var" that 
              you made in the javascript page so it can appear once you click the image. You add an 
              event listener and an "if else" statement for each picture and info pair you want to use.
