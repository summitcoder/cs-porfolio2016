              Hitler's rise to power was able to happen because of the isntability that Germany
              was in during the 1930's. This was because the amount of war reparations that 
              Germany had to pay after WW1 was too much and caused its economy to lose control.
              Since Germany had to pay large amounts of money it decided to print more money 
              and therefore caused inflation, making the problem worse for Germany. While all of 
              this was happening the Nazi party was ganning momentum as they opposed communism and 
              promised to get Germany back to its former glory. Hitler took his first step to power 
              when he was elected chancellor of Germany and his party got the majorty seats in the 
              senate. A year later hitler took full control of the country and began to build up the 
              German army to prepare for his conquest of Germany.

               The German army swept europe with its blitzkreig which took out many countries of 
               europe in the late 1930's. After Hitler had proven the effectiveness of his army in 
               eastern europe and in the invasion of Poland, he turned his sights on western europe, 
               France and Britain declared war on Germany. Hitler then invaded Belgium and with its 
               blitzkreig took over France in just 6 weeks and it marked the nazi occupation of mainland 
               europe. This would help the German's final solution plan speed up and be able to take
               people from all over europe.

               The Battle of Britain was one of the most important parts of WW2 only rivaling the D-Day
               landings in 1944. This battle destroyed the ability for the German air force to mount any 
               major air attack on the allies for the rest of the war. The German loses were way higher 
               than the RAF (Royal Air Force) and Britain had the ability to replace its fighters way 
               faster as they were cheaper and easier to mass produce. The German fighters on the other 
               hand were more expensive and more complex to produce. So it took more time and more money 
               to produce these bombers and fighters, which ultimately led to the failure of the German 
               air offensive over the skies of Britain. The Germans had the Bf-109 and the Brits had the 
               spitfire both were really good fighters and were almost evenly matched so when it came down 
               to a war of attrition the Brits were able to win with sheer numbers.

               The nazi invasion of the Soviet Union was done for many reasons, some idiological and some 
               for material gain. Hitler believed that communism was the worst thing that human kind had
               to offer, he believed that it should be taken off the face of the earth. So in June 1941 
               Hitler invaded the USSR and the German blitzkrieg was in full swing. The German army was at
               the gates of Moscow but winter came later that year and stalled the German offensive and 
               allowed for the Russians to push the Germans back. Hitler also invaded the Soviet Union 
               because of the oil fields that the Soviet union had in the caucasus. So Hitler started his 
               seige of Stalingrad as an insult to Stalin and also to provide a staging spot for the 
               invasion of the caucasus to the south. Hitler was hard pressed for the oil fields 
               because of the Allied bombing campaign over europe, which destroyed a lot of its oil 
               refineries and its synthetic oil refineries. Hitler also wanted to use the huge farmable 
               land in the USSR to be able to feed all of its population
