            Every since I was very young I have played and had dogs. My favorite type of dog is a german sheperd because they are strong but also have cute sweet side. I enjoy being able to walk and play with my dogs because I find good companionship with dogs. I
            had a dog name blue, I had him for over a year he was very hyper and active. He was very attached to me he would cry really loud everytime I would leave the house, because of this I had to give him away. He was fun to play with, I loved watching
            him run and munch on his huge bowl of food with ease.

            I am mormon and in my religion men and women go on their mission most go right after highschool I am choosing to go at 18 so right after highschool. You file paper work to go and the apostels and the prophet pray about each applicant to see where god 
            wants the missionaries to go and where they need them. You have the chance to be called to any country that allows the missionaries you teach in the language of that country or the languauge that is mainly spoken in that region. You spread the gospel 
            and teach the people of that country and region.

            I love to play a lot video games specially FPS (first person shooters). The games that I really like to play are War Thunder and the Battle field franchise. I really enjoy playing War Thunder because I really enjoy flying airplanes and the game tries
            to make it as realistic it can be. If your flaps or wings are badly damaged it will be really hard to move your airplane and it wont have as much maneuverability as it did before and would make you an easy target to any fighter. You have to try to 
            make it back to an airfield to repair which makes it hard and rewarding if you make it. I really like the Battle Field franchise because you can destroy whole buildings and other structures and tries to make it as realistic as possiible.
