                In this project we had to make bots that would compete againts each other in an arena. The bot that had the most amount of gold in the end would win the game. This required us to code the AI so it would seek mines, go to taverns when its low health and
                attack other bots when it can. We put our bots in a server to go againts other peoples bots and see who can code the best bot. The more complex your code is the better chance your bot has to win. The server sends your bot information and
                then your bot uses that information to do things that will allow it to win.

        }
        
        The overall strategy for my bot is to get mines that are free and then attack enemy bots when it has done that. 
        so basically go on a killing spree to get the mines that other bots have.

     This piece of code is so my bot goes to get health for when it has taken damage from other bots.
     So I need to make an "if" statement to kick off this line of code. So our task is tavern then we 
     make a "var" to make the bot go after the tavern that is the closest to my bot. You need to find 
     the length from you to the tavern that appears closest to you. So the "i++" goes through every 
     mine that is close to you until it finds the mine that is closest to my bot.

            console.log("You are the best, you collected a mine");
            myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, closemine)
        }
     
     This part of my code is for finding mines that are not owned by any players so I can get gold 
     in order to win the game. The "var" is "closemine" to identify that the bot needs to find the 
     closest mine that is free. So if the bot has 0 mines the bot will run the code above. After it 
     figures out that it needs mines it will looks for the closest mine to him. To do this it takes 
     the position of the bot relative to the mine that is closest to him, it goes through a loop 
     picking which mine is the closets to the bot, so it can determine which one to go to. It checks 
     the distance between the bot and the mine and picks the one that is the closest to the bot.

        myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, killEnemyBots.posArray)

    This part of my code is so my bot can attack other bots after its done getting mines. I did this so it would 
    get gold while it was fighting other bots and it would get the mines that other bots owned. This part of my 
    code is at the end and is an else statement so it only runs if all the parts of the code obove it are done. 
    So like the rest of the code for the mines and the taverns I need to add a part of the code that finds the 
    distance from me and other bots. So I need to find bots in order for me to kill them, how I do that is use 
    my var "killEnemyBots" and add "posArray" to it so I can find the x,y coordinates of them.

     I did not have a chance to test my bot in the arena but it did what I wanted it to when I was practicing.
     I ran into some troubles when it came to making it what I wanted to do since I did not fully understand the 
     "language" in the sense that I could not read the code and fully understand what each part of the code meant.
     For me it was very complicated to learn how to do the simple steps of making the bot. I did not know what each
     line of code meant and had trouble moving forward with out teacher help or peer help. My preseption of AI 
     changed a lot because I thought they were semi-atonomous and did not need a lot of code but now I know that 
     they completely rely on code to know what to do and to "adapt" to a changing situation. This project really 
     pushed me to get things done and try my hardest to understand the code that I was typing and get appropiate 
     help when I needed it.
