              This is my navbar to make this you need a combination of html and 
              css to make it. You have to have links in order to move from page 
              to page so first we put href to designate where the links are 
              going to take us. We created the links in the navebar so now we 
              need to put a title on top of that. We need to the center to make 
              it look good, so we put a h1 tag to center and make the title 
              green. As you can see below in the bottom part of the image thats 
              how you could make the tittle align in the center and turn it green.

    </div>
    
    </div>
        <p style="width: 75s%;" class="font-size white-text">
              Now that you have made the navbar you can add images to the page. 
              When I added images to my page I let the images fall in the let 
              side because that where the fall once you put the image in. For 
              the text I had to move it to the side so it would be next to the 
              image, I did this because I liked the text on the side of the 
              image instead of under the image. I repeated this for all of my 
              other images since I like that style. This style might be hard to 
              read at times since the text block is long and it might seem 
              longer at certain points. The background sometimes makes it harder
              for someone to read the text because of the different color in it.

        How to use CSS

     </div>
        <p style="width: 75s%;" class="font-size white-text">
              We use CSS to make things look better in this case you can make 
              the text and the navbar look better. As you can see below I used 
              CSS to make the nabar link color blue and the border around the 
              text look black. To make the title about CSS you have to make 
              different classes in the CSS tab. To make this title I had to 
              make a class to make the text white and also center it. To make 
              each class you need to put a bracket to start it and one at the
              end to mark it down as a line of code but for the navbar we 
              need to put it before the bracket. For the navbar we needed 
              to id it in the html so then we put a # to mark it down in the CSS
              tab this marked it as code. Inside the bracket we put how we want 
              the navbar look by adding classes for the display, border, padding,
              border-radius and background-color. For mine I had to choose 
              specific sizes for the border and padding, so I put the size
              that I saw fit for each to do this I put a number then px. For 
              the border you need to put solid black so the border stands out 
              from the rest. For the background I put black after the colon
              which is the color that would show up as your background color I
              put this so only the letters would show up when the webpage has a 
              black or dark background.

        How to make a todo list Using HTML 
    </h1>
    
    </div>
        <p style="width: 75s%;" class="font-size white-text">
               First you need to make the HTML for the skeleton of your to do list.
               With the HTMl you make the buttons for the to do and the box where the 
               numbers go. The code for the box is <img src="piicture 1.png"> this 
               creates a space for you to put the item you want for the to do list.
               Now you need a button to be able to put the item you want to complete. 
               We put a button so we have a way to make the item list stay as part 
               of a list. This is the code for the button <img src="picture 2.png">
               You also have to put values which put different colors and types of
               text to highlight the importance of the itme in the list. You have
               the option of having no text type, red, Bold, Italics and underline. 
               <img src="picture 3.png"> Each one of these is an option you have to
               change how the text looks. 
        </p>

        How to make a todo list Using Javascript 
    </h1>
    
        </div>
        <p style="width: 75s%;" class="font-size white-text">
               First you need to make a variable for your button, your display,
               textstyle and the action the person is making. You have to 
               declare a variable before the heavy coding takes place because
               a var is like a box you are creating and next to the var we put
               the name of that box so what ever we put after the equals sign 
               is what we are "putting inside of that box." <img src="picture 4.png">
               So then we need to make the button work so we add an event listener 
               so when the user clicks the button it does something. <img src="picture 5.png">
               When it comes to coding the part where you add different text types
               you write "if" statements and "else if" statements so when a user 
               chooses an option the code know what to do with that information.
               I put an if statement first which means that it would the neutral 
               option and the "if else" statements come in after the user chooses 
               a different option and chooses the correct option that was chosen.
               <img src="picture 6.png"> As you can see the bottom one is an 
               "if else" statement that means that if the user does not want the
               option to be "none" it chooses the option of "red" and that allows 
               the code to change the properties of the text and put into effect 
               option that was selected.
