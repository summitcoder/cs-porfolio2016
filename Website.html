              WW2 was the bloodiest conflict in the history of the modern world.
              It involved over 48 different countries and was fought on 6 
              different continents. 60 million people died in the 6 years of 
              fighting (1939-1945). A lot of these were civilian as Nazi Germany 
              inacted the "final Solution" that brought the killing of jewish 
              people where 6 million jews were killed, but it was not limited to
              jewish people. The Nazis wanted believed in the aryan race which 
              was blond hairs and blue eyes. This meant anyone that did not fit 
              that description was impure and should be eraticated. WW2 Sparked
              when Hitler invaded France and took control of all of europe. This 
              involved Great Britain and all of its empire. The United States was
              brought into the war as Japan attacked pearl harbor in an attempt to
              cripple the pacific fleet but was unsuccessful and in return brought 
              the United States into the global conflict. Hitler then invaded the
              Soviet Union as it saw it as a threat to his country and he despised
              communism. After the invasion of the Soviet Union all of the major 
              powers of the world were now involved.

             Throughout the course of the war their were key battles that turned the tide
             one way or another, some more than others but each played a big role in the 
             victory and deaths of the allied and axis soldiers. Most of the key battles 
             took place on land but air and naval power determined the winner of the battle. 
             Battles also depended on the side with the industrial might and the amount of
             resources they could provide to the soldiers fighting the battle, which in
             most cases was the allies. The quality of the weapons and machines also played 
             a huge role in the outcome of the battle, airplanes like the spitfire and the 
             p-51 gave the alllies air superiority over the skies of europe. The United
             States's ability to replace its sherman tanks faster than Germany could 
             allowed the allies to have a numerical superiority and turn the tide of battles. 
             The ability for the allies to provide resources to the soviet union during its 
             campaign againts Germany allowed the Soviet Union to have a continued attack 
             and allow the allies to have a foothold in europe.

             The role of land vehicles was very big in ww2, the amoun of tanks or the effectiveness
             of the vehicle dictated who one the engagement between 2 forces. If 2 infantry
             forces are engaging each other the one with the best and most vehicle support 
             has a higher chance of coming out victorious in the engagement. The Sherman tanks 
             are legendary in ww2 because of how fast the United States could replace them. The 
             Tiger series tanks were also legendary tanks of WW2 because of how powerful the 
             85 mm cannon was and how heavily armored the tank was. The t-34 series tanks was 
             another legendary tank as it was a good blend between armor, mobility and fire power. 
             Armored vehicles weren't the only key part of a battle that won certain battles. Non
             combat vehicles were also very essential as they transported supplies to the front
             lines, transported men and wounded back to field hospitals. Tractors and other 
             utility vehicles were also essential to the war effort as the could clear debris left 
             by the enemy or could move knocked out tanks that were blocking roads.

             WW2 showed the importance of air superiority in a battle and in the war in general.
             Over the skies of europe B-17 bombers and Lancasters bombers destroyed industrial 
             facilities all over europe to cripple the nazi war effort and keep its air superiority. 
             As bombers conducted air raids German Bf-109's shot them down inflicting massive 
             casualties, this was because the fighters at that time could not escort the bombers
             all the way to the bombing targets. The allies solution to this was night bombing but
             it proved extremely ineffective so the United States created the p-51, this fighter
             could escort the bombers all the way to the target and come back with them. Ground 
             attack aircraft like the Il-2 and ju 87 aka stuka, played a huge role in ground 
             campaigns as they could provide surveillance in the heat of battle but more 
             importantly they could provide fire support for the troops on the ground, these 
             airplanes could mean the difference between victory and defeat. C-47 airplanes 
             were the main transport planes that dropped airborne troops into europe and 
             allowed the allies to drop troops fast and anywhere on the battlefield.
