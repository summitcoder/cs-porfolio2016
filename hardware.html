             The motherboard holds the basic circuitry and  components of a computer. Circuit boards have slots where you can slot circuit boards. This is basically the center part of the computer and is a very important part of the computer. 
             The motherboard has a microprocessor, memory, basic input/output system (BIOS), and Interconnecting circuitry. You can also add to components to the motherboard by putting an expansion slot.

              The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the part of the computer that receives all the commands. It responds and processes to all the instructions that are given to the computer. The processor has 4 jobs these are fetch, decode, execute and writeback. 
              The basic parts of a CPU are an arithmetic log unit (ALU) which arithmetic and logic operations  on instructions. Another part of the CPU is the floating point unit (FPU) this is a coprocessor that has the manipulate number or process them faster 
              than a microprocessor, Registers are in charge of registering all of the responses that are done by the ALU and they supply them operands. The last part of the CPU is the L1 and L2 memory cache this allows for the storage of certain things go faster 
              since it does not have to go through the RAM. The CPU is useful not just for simple commands on your computer. You can also run games and be a hardcore gamer if thats what you are into.

             The RAM (Random access memory) is a place in the computer where you keep current programs and data are kept for quick access. The data is unloaded from the RAM once the computer is off and loaded back into the RAM once the computer is back on. 
             The RAM basically keeps all your data for a short period of time like someone with short term memory.  When the RAM fills up it sends its data to the hard disk and it repeats this process until the Hard disk is filled up.

            The Hard drive is a container that hold the hard disks that can store all of your dank memes. The difference between the RAM and hard drive is that you can still keep everything you store even after the computer is off. This allows the computer 
            to have big amounts of storage in a small space.

         The BUS takes data from different parts of the computer to other parts of the computer for example from the CPU to the main memory. The size of the BUS matter in terms of width because the wider the more data can be transferred it is measured in units like 
         32-bit and 16-bits this means the BUS can transfer 16 or 32 bits of data depending on its size.

            The mouse has evolved to the type of mice we have today. The early mouse had a roller that moved two rollers that spun wheels that turned electrical pulses that represented direction and speed. Optical mouses were to replace these mouses since the roll 
            got dirty and negatively affected the mouseâ€™s performance. The optical mouse works by taking thousands of pictures a second so it can track how the mouse is moving and has an LED to light the path of the little camera.

           The keyboard was an evolution from the typewriter. The invention paved way for the development of the keyboard.the keyboard is used to type out words in a computer and access other websites by typing them in. Their are different types of keyboards like 
           mechanical keyboards and chiclets keyboards which are the ones that are very commonly used in other computer.

            In order for a computer to be complete you need to be able to see the things you are clicking and typing this is where the monitor comes into play the monitor shows everything that the computer is showing. It lets you watch videos, see what you are 
            writing and lets you look at those spicy memes. The computer needs every part of its components to work at its full potential but if a computer doesn't some of its key elements it wont work. In the current progress of technology their has been a push
            in touch screen technology which allows you to type and click with out using a seprate mouse or keyboard.
